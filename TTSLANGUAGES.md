# About
I ran a test to find out what TTS languages and voices were installed when I imported the speech recognition module, so here is a list of the useful ones.
NOTE: The list negates a lot of languages and voices (since many are just variants of the same language, e.g: Spanish, or were just different voices for the same language)
The code for speech recognition languages should be the same.

## Languages to note of:
- English: en-US, en-GB (Gun crime and knife crime respectively)
- Spanish: es-ES
- German: de-DE
- French: fr-FR
- Portuguese: pt-BR (Brazilian)
- Dutch: nl-NL
- Italian: it-IT
- Thai: th-TH
- Japanese: ja-JP
- Hindi: hi-IN
- Vietnamese: vi_VN
- Chinese: zh-CN
- Russian: ru-RU
- Korean: ko-KR
- Polish: pl-PL
