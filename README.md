# Coursework
So there's like, a lot of stuff to install/import

## Libraries to install (at least what I had to do)
So the following libraries to install (using "pip install 'name'" in terminal) (assuming you are using macOS)
- langchain
- langchain-core
- langchain-openai
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
- py3-tts (came across an error, had to do this to get tts working)
- streamlit
- PyAudio

## To run the code:
- Open terminal
- Go to the folder directory for the coursework
- Run the following command: "streamlit run Translation\ Mode.py"
- If the program asks for permission to use your microphone, accept it.
