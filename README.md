# Coursework
So there's like, a lot of stuff to install/import

## Libraries to install (at least what I had to do)
So the following libraries to install (using "pip install 'name'" in terminal) (assuming you are using macOS)
- python-dotenv
- langchain
- langchain-core
- langchain-community
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
- py3-tts (came across an error, had to do this to get tts working)
- streamlit
If the command 'pip' is not found, use pip3 instead.


## To run the code:
- Open terminal
- Go to the folder directory for the coursework
- Run the following command: "python main.py"
- If the program asks for permission to use your microphone, accept it.

## env files
~~So at the moment once you've opened up the folder, create a new text file called "env", and inside it, you'll put an API key inside that.
Copy paste the following: OPENAI_API_KEY=""
Inside those quotation marks is where you'll put the API key. Since OpenAI is watching us, when we get the API key we'll strictly keep it confidential (write it down on paper and hold onto that paper for you life?)~~
UPDATE: We got an API key, will share it somewhere else confidentially. Maybe encode (in binary? hex?) and decode it or something to make the process easier for the end user.
